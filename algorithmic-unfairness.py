# C[k,j] is the historical grade distribution of grade at the school (centre) over the last three years, 2017-19.
# q[k,j] is the predicted grade distribution based on the classâ€™s prior attainment at GCSEs. A class with mostly 9s (the top grade) at GCSE will get a lot of predicted A*s; a class with mostly 1s at GCSEs will get a lot of predicted Us.
# p[k,j] is the predicted grade distribution of the previous years, based on their GCSEs. You need to know that because, if previous years were predicted to do poorly and did well, then this year might do the same.
# r[j] is the fraction of pupils in the class where historical data is available. If you can perfectly track down every GCSE result, then it is 1; if you cannot track down any, it is 0.
# CAG is the centre assessed grade.
# P[k,j] is the result, which is the grade distribution for each grade k at each school j.
